# Golf-Bag-Manager
This is my first project in C#. What was most vauable to me for this project was learning the syntax and implementation of the C# langueage while also practicing using Claude for testing and debugging, I feel like I leanred many valuable skills and am looking forward to evolving my skills in this language to make me a better programmer. Test output is at the end of GolfBagDriver.cs.

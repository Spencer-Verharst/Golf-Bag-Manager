# Golf-Bag-Manager
This is my first project in C#. What was most vauable to me for this project was learning the syntax and implementation of the C# langueage while also practicing using Claude for testing and debugging, I feel like I learned many valuable skills and am looking forward to evolving my skills in this language to make me a better programmer. Test output is at the end of GolfBagDriver.cs.

Edits
* Made it a list implementation instead of an array
* Driver is where the questions are asked and function is where the club is added to the bag instead of the function doing both
* Input validation is instant instead of getting kicked back to main menu
* Style and spacing
